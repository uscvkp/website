Embedded Systems: ARM Programming and Optimization combines an exploration of
the ARM architecture with an examination of the facilities offered by the Linux
Operating System to explain how various features of program design can influence
processor performance. It demonstrates methods by which a programmer can optimize
program code in a way that does not impact its behavior but improves its
performance. Several applications, including image transformations, fractal
generation, image convolution, and computer vision tasks, are used to describe
and demonstrate these methods. From this, the reader will gain insight into
computer architecture and application design, as well as gain practical knowledge
in the area of embedded software design for modern embedded systems.

<p>
Covers three ARM instruction set architectures, the ARMv6 and ARMv7-A, as well as
three ARM cores, the ARM11 on the Raspberry Pi, Cortex-A9 on the Xilinx Zynq 7020,
and Cortex-A15 on the NVIDIA Tegra K1 Describes how to fully leverage the
facilities offered by the Linux operating system, including the Linux GCC
compiler toolchain and debug tools, performance monitoring support, OpenMP
multicore runtime environment, video frame buffer, and video capture capabilities
Designed to accompany and work with most of the low cost Linux/ARM embedded
development boards currently available.

<p>
The modern consumer electronics industry as we know it owes much of its success
and popularity to two technologies: the ARM processor and the Linux operating
system. ARM processor technology powers nearly all modern mobile devices―and most
of these processors run the Linux operating system. It’s no exaggeration to say
that having an understanding of embedded system design and development from the
context of ARM and Linux technology is an important asset in today’s world.

This textbook combines an exploration of the ARM architecture with an examination
of the facilities offered by the Linux operating system to explain how various
features of program design can influence processor performance. It demonstrates
methods by which a programmer can make changes to code without changing program
semantics, but have a significant impact on code performance. Several applications,
including image transformations, fractal generation, image convolution, and computer
vision tasks, are used to describe and demonstrate these methods. From this, the
reader will gain insight into computer architecture and application design, as
well as gain practical knowledge in the area of embedded software design for modern
embedded systems.
