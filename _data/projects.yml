                 The objective of this project is to develop applications,
                 development tools, and abstractions for automata processing,
                 an emerging processing technology comprised of a massively
                 parallel array of elements that form nondeterministic finite
                 automata.

                 This project will develop a runtime system for autonomously
                 mapping computer vision kernel functions to various processors
                 in a new type of heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip
                 architecture designed by Texas Instruments.

  description  : >
                 The objective of this project is to develop a distributed controller
                 framework for medium voltage DC converters.  The framework is
                 comprised of an array of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
                 interconnected on a multi-hop network with optical links.
